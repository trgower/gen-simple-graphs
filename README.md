# gen-simple-graphs
Generates all simple graphs with n vertices and saves as an adjacency matrix.

## Compile & Run
* g++ -std=c++11 gen_simple_graphs.cc -o run
* ./run
* Make sure your compiler uses C++11

## Output
* n<number of vertices>g<graph number>.txt
* For example on n = 3 the first graph would be n3g1.txt
* Adjacency Matrix
